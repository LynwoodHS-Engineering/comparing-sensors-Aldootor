1. The Raspberry Pi senses the environment around by recieving signals from the active and passive sensors and turning them into data it can understand.

2. Some environmental factors that might influence the performance of these sensors are temperature, light, sound, and obstacles can affect how well the exteroceptive and proprioceptive sensors work.

3. Coding tells the Raspberry Pi how to read data from the passive and active sensors as well as what to do with the information it gets from the proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors.
